WeatherApp

The WeatherApp provides users with real-time weather data by allowing them to input a zip code, city, state, or country. Upon submission, users receive detailed information such as the current temperature, sunset time, humidity levels, wind speeds, and more.

This application leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve accurate weather data. Developed as part of a local Hackathon at the University of Maryland, the project enabled contributors to enhance their knowledge of both the syntax and functionality of the React framework, as well as JavaScript and CSS.
